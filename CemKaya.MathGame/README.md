# Math Game App

## Introduction

This project was created to reinforce my .NET skills. The idea for the project was inspired by The C# Academy's Math Game tutorial ([thecsharpacademy.com](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/53/math-game)). While building the project, I incorporated additional .NET concepts for learning purposes. Along with the most commonly used .NET concepts, this project also helped me grasp and improve my knowledge of the following topics:

- Separation of concerns
- Records
- Tuples
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Switch expressions
- Enums

## Key Concepts Implemented

### Separation of Concerns

I applied the principle of separation of concerns by dividing the application into distinct components, each responsible for a specific task. This approach promotes code organization, maintainability, and testability.

### Records

I utilized records to create immutable data structures, ensuring that the state of the game and player information remained consistent throughout the application's lifecycle.

### Tuples

Tuples helped me efficiently return multiple values from methods, simplifying the implementation of game logic and enhancing code readability.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

I incorporated OOP principles, such as encapsulation and abstraction, to create a well-structured and modular application. This approach allowed me to manage complexity and promote code reuse.

### Switch Expressions

Switch expressions provided a concise and readable way to handle multiple cases in the game logic, improving the overall code quality and maintainability.

### Enums

Enums were used to define the available operations and difficulty levels, ensuring type safety and enhancing the readability of the code.

## Conclusion

Building this Math Game App was an excellent opportunity to reinforce my .NET skills and explore various concepts that are widely used in .NET development. By incorporating these concepts, I gained a deeper understanding of .NET and improved my ability to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code. This project serves as a testament to my growth as a .NET developer and a stepping stone for future learning and development.
